# Physics-Simulation


This application is a simulator that simulates the physical rules that how gravity,momentum and pushes are applied to objects. 


 The physics simulator allows you to :
 
 1) Send balls to environment.
 2) Give initial velocities and mass to the balls.
 3) Add obstacles 
 
 
 4) Change size of obstacles,balls
 5) Set gravity, restitution
 **6) Draw velocity/time, Acceralation/time and Position/time graphics.
